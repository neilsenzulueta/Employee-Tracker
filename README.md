## Installation 

The following commands will help install the necessary packages for this application. 
* `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` to install inquirer. 
* `npm install --save mysql2` to install MySQL.
* `npm install console.table --save` to install console.table

## Usage 

Once all packages are properly installed. Use command `mysql -u root -p` to access database in the command-line. User will need a MySQL account and will be authenticated. To run the app, enter `npm start`. User will be allowed to access employee details (please see main menu screenshot below).  User will also be allowed to add new departments, new roles, and new employees.  Finally, user will have access to update current employee's role.
